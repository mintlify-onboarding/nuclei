## Automate Vulnerability Scans with **Nuclei**

Nuclei can help you ensure the security of complex networks / applications. With vulnerability scans,
Nuclei can identify security issues on your network. Once configured, Nuclei can
provide detailed information on each vulnerability, including:

- Severity
- Impact
- Description
- Remediation

Once you've set up templates, you can automate scans of your systems with every change
to your network, and with every discovery of new security issues.

In this Getting Started guide, we describe how you can set up Nuclei to automate
vulnerability scans on a relatively simple network. You can then use our [Templating
Guide](/templating-guide/introduction) to customize Nuclei for your networks.
